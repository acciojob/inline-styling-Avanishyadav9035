			The principal purpose of a flower is the reproduction of the individual and the species. All flowering plants are heterosporous, that is, every individual plant produces two types of spores. Microspores are produced by meiosis inside anthers and megaspores are produced inside ovules that are within an ovary.

			Flowers are the reproductive structures of flowering plants (angiosperms) and come in a variety of colors, shapes, and sizes. They play a vital role in plant reproduction by attracting pollinators such as bees, butterflies, and birds. Flowers consist of different parts, including petals, sepals, stamens (male reproductive organs), and pistils (female reproductive organs). Some flowers have a pleasant fragrance, while others produce nectar to attract pollinators. Besides their biological significance, flowers are also used for decoration, gifts, and medicinal purposes. Popular flowers include roses, lilies, tulips, and sunflowers, each carrying unique meanings and symbolism.
